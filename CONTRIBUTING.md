We love your input! We want to make contributing to Thinking-Time-Prompts as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Contributing Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added prompts, please test them with different LLMs.
3. If you've changed existing prompts, document the improvements.
4. Ensure your description is clear and complete.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Guidelines for Submitting New Prompts

When submitting new prompts, please ensure they:

1. Are clear and well-formatted
2. Include explanations of their purpose and intended effects
3. Have been tested with at least one LLM
4. Include example responses showing effectiveness
5. Follow the existing prompt structure and style

## Testing Guidelines

Before submitting a prompt:

1. Test with at least one major LLM (e.g., o1, deepseek-r1, etc.)
2. Document the model's response time
3. Compare response quality with and without the prompt
4. Note any limitations or specific conditions for best results
