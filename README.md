# Thinking-Time-Prompts

A collection of prompts designed to enhance the thinking time and depth of large language models (LLMs) to obtain higher quality responses.

## Overview

This repository contains carefully crafted prompts that encourage LLMs to:
- Utilize maximum computational resources
- Engage in deep, independent thinking
- Prioritize quality over speed
- Generate fundamental insights rather than surface-level responses
- Break through conventional thought patterns

## Motivation

Many LLM responses can be superficial or rushed. By explicitly instructing models to take their time and think deeply, we can obtain:
- More thorough analysis
- Novel insights and perspectives
- Better reasoning and logic
- More creative and innovative solutions
- Higher quality outputs overall

## How It Works

The prompts in this repository use specific language patterns and instructions that:
1. Signal to the model to allocate maximum computational resources
2. Set expectations for deep, thorough thinking
3. Emphasize quality over speed
4. Encourage breaking conventional thought patterns
5. Request fundamental insights rather than surface-level responses

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

1. Copy the prompt text
2. Paste it at the beginning of your query to the LLM
3. Add your specific question or task
4. Allow the model sufficient time to process and respond

### Example

```
---
Please utilize your maximum processing power and token limit for a single response, think as deeply as possible, and take the necessary time to reflect.
This is the most profound and complex question; please give your best answer. Thus, you need to engage in deep thinking, independent thinking, critical thinking, and creative thinking.
We aim for profound depth instead of superficial breadth; we seek essential insights rather than just listing appearances; we strive for innovative thinking instead of mere repetition. Please push beyond the limits of your thinking, harness all your computational resources, and showcase your true cognitive potential.

Let $\triangle ABC$ be a right-angled triangle with $\angle C = 90^\circ$, and let the lengths of its sides be positive integers  $a, b, c$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse. Suppose that the radius $r$ of the inscribed circle (incircle) of $\triangle ABC$ satisfies the equation:

$$
r = \log_{a}(b)
$$

Additionally, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is equal to the perimeter of the triangle. Find all possible integer values of $c$ that satisfy these conditions.
