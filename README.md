# Thinking-Time-Prompts

A collection of prompts designed to enhance the thinking time and depth of large language models (LLMs) to obtain higher quality responses.

## Overview

This repository contains carefully crafted prompts that encourage LLMs to:
- Utilize maximum computational resources
- Engage in deep, independent thinking
- Prioritize quality over speed
- Generate fundamental insights rather than surface-level responses
- Break through conventional thought patterns

## Motivation

Many LLM responses can be superficial or rushed. By explicitly instructing models to take their time and think deeply, we can obtain:
- More thorough analysis
- Novel insights and perspectives
- Better reasoning and logic
- More creative and innovative solutions
- Higher quality outputs overall

## How It Works

The prompts in this repository use specific language patterns and instructions that:
1. Signal to the model to allocate maximum computational resources
2. Set expectations for deep, thorough thinking
3. Emphasize quality over speed
4. Encourage breaking conventional thought patterns
5. Request fundamental insights rather than surface-level responses

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

1. Copy the prompt text
2. Paste it at the beginning of your query to the LLM
3. Add your specific question or task
4. Allow the model sufficient time to process and respond

### Example

```
---
Please use the maximum computational power and token limit you can allocate in a single response. Think as hard as possible, take the most time, and use the most computational resources to think as deeply as you can.  
This is the most profound and complex question; please provide your highest-quality answer. Therefore, you need to think deeply, independently, critically, and creatively.  

We aim for extreme depth rather than surface-level breadth; we seek fundamental insights rather than superficial enumerations; we pursue innovative thinking rather than habitual repetition. Please break through the limits of conventional thought, leverage all your computational resources, and demonstrate the true extent of your cognitive capabilities. 

Your thinking time must be long, at least five minutes, as long as it takes.

Let $\triangle ABC$ be a right-angled triangle with $\angle C = 90^\circ$, and let the lengths of its sides be positive integers  $a, b, c$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse. Suppose that the radius $r$ of the inscribed circle (incircle) of $\triangle ABC$ satisfies the equation:

$$
r = \log_{a}(b)
$$

Additionally, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is equal to the perimeter of the triangle. Find all possible integer values of $c$ that satisfy these conditions.
